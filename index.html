        <h2>the longest rally</h2>
        <p>"It was the longest rally in the history of the sport. The ball was hit back and forth between the two players for 29 minutes and 643 shots. The rally took place in the 1984 Wimbledon Championships, in a match between John McEnroe and Mats Wilander.</p>
        <p>McEnroe was the first to serve, and he hit a powerful serve that Wilander returned with a forehand. McEnroe hit a backhand, and Wilander returned it with a forehand. McEnroe hit a forehand, and Wilander returned it with a backhand. McEnroe hit a forehand, and Wilander returned it with a forehand. McEnroe hit a backhand, and Wilander returned it with a forehand.

        <p>McEnroe won the match, but Wilander won the rally. The rally was so long that the umpire had to call a time-out to allow the players to rest. The crowd was on the edge of their seats, and the players were exhausted." *</p>

        <p>Depending on where you encounter this work, different terms will apply.</p>
        <p>For example, if you encounter this work on terms-apply.com, the terms of service of terms-apply.com will apply (they have not been defined). If you encounter this work on eriklumbela.com, the terms of service of eriklumbela.com will apply (they have not been defined).</p>
        <p>If you encounter this work through Chrome, the terms of service of Chrome will apply. Likewise, if you encounter this work from your Apple device, the terms of service of Apple will apply.</p><p>If you encounter this work in The Netherlands, Dutch law will apply. If you encounter this work in the city of Rotterdam, the Algemene Plaatselijke Verordening of Rotterdam will apply. If you encounter this work inside a building, the terms of service of that particular building will apply.</p>
        <p class="center"><b>And so on.</b></p>
        <p>These are all written terms. There are also unwritten terms, like moral, ethical, and social codes. These terms are not strictly defined and are more reliant on individual perspectives.</p>
        <p>At any given place there are numerous terms that apply. Some of these terms are written, some are implicit. Some of these terms are defined, some are not. Some of these terms are strict, some are loose. Some of these terms are enforced, some are not. On top of that, terms may be subject to change without notice</p>

      <div class="work texts all time-pieces quetta-second">
        <h2>quetta-second</h2>
        <p>It appears that the necessity for a "quetta" stems from the need to describe data volumes. It doesn't seem to be inherently related to time, but rather, it serves as a unit of measurement that can also be applied to other quantities.</p>
        <p>The introduction of "quetta" into the metric system took place in 2022, concurrently with the inclusion of other units like "ronna," "ronto," and "quecto."</p>
        <p>The primary reason for introducing new measurement units is to 'allow clear and unambiguous communication of measurements for many years to come' (R. Brown).</p>

      <div class="work texts all time-pieces the-next-ice-age">
        <h2>The next ice age</h2>
        <h3>might start in another 75,000 years</h3>
        <p>It's not easy to predict when the next ice age will begin, but it's estimated to occur in approximately 75,000 years. When I refer to an ice age I mean a glacial period, a time when substantial portions of Earth are covered in ice. Currently we are technically in an ice age, specifically in an interglacial period. However, the term ice age can have varying interpretations depending on who you ask.</p>
        <p> Anyway in the next ice age, I envision Earth resembling the icy landscapes of Star Wars' Hoth. I think I might prefer the warmer conditions of a Greenhouse Earth.</p>
        <p>If we take 75,000 years as a given and assume an average human lifespan of 76 years, the next ice age is projected to occur in approximately 987 lifetimes.</p>
